Hi, my name is Robert. Iâ€™m Ruby and JS programmer. I like to learn new things and participate in hackathons.

When I have free time, I climb and explore caves in Tatra Mountains.

If you want, you can grab my CV [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Wk2zLBWfwTs5o2bQYlEB-F9DjpiXAEwq/view?usp=sharing), but I'm not looking for a job at the moment. Also, you can check my [LinkedIn Profile](https://linkedin.com/in/rbglod).
